# EXP1.-TO-STUDY-THE-CHARACTERISTICS-OF-INSTRUMENTATION-AMPLIFIER

## Aim :
To study and calibrate Instrumentation Amplifiers.

## Procedure:

Step 1: Simulator will open the circuit diagram of Instrumentation Amplifier Student will initiate the simulator To aware the connection diagram of Instrumentation amplifier.

Step 2: Simulator will allow to change supply voltage from AC or DC voltage Student will select the button of voltage type from input section To aware the type of supply from AC or DC voltage.

Step 3: Simulator will show the value of V1 and V2 at the node of supply value Student will allow to change the supply voltage of V1 and V2 by clicking the mouse button on slide bar to obtain the voltage of V1 and V2 .

Step 4: Simulator will give the value of R1, R2 and R3 and shown on the diagram Student will change the value of resistor by clicking on the slide bar To show the value of R1, R2, R3.

Step 5: Simulator will display value of Vout or output voltage Student will allow to obtain the value of Vout or output voltage by clicking on the Vout button To obtain the value of Vout of Instrumentation Amplifier

Step 6: Simulator will make a graph on the right side of the simulator interaction Student will allow to obtain the graph To obtain the graph of Instrumentation amplifier.
